Project: SymptoTwin – AI Biomedical Health Twin
Goal: Build a modern, responsive React website frontend with Flask backend for predicting health risks based on symptoms. Efficient, hackathon-ready code that runs smoothly.

Requirements:

Frontend (React):
- Use React functional components with hooks.
- Responsive layout with Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap.
- Pages:
  1. Landing page: Hero section, project title, Start Assessment button.
  2. Assessment page: Form to input Age, Sex (radio), Symptoms (multi-select or checkboxes), Submit button.
  3. Results page: Show predicted conditions with probability %.
     - Elegant cards for each condition.
     - Color-coded risk levels (Green: low, Yellow: medium, Red: high).
     - Optional: Interactive bar chart using Chart.js or Recharts.
- Include a header and footer.
- Smooth animations for page transitions or card hover effects.
- Form input validation.

Backend (Flask):
- API server in Python Flask.
- Routes:
  1. /api/predict: POST request, receives JSON {age, sex, symptoms[]}.
     - Map symptoms to API-compatible evidence format.
     - Call Infermedica API (or mock API if needed).
     - Return top 5 predicted conditions with probabilities as JSON.
  2. Optional: /api/simulate: POST request to simulate lifestyle changes and adjust probabilities.
- Efficient: handle multiple requests quickly, avoid redundant calls.
- Use separate utils.py for helper functions (symptom mapping, API call).

Integration:
- Frontend calls Flask API using Axios or Fetch.
- Display results dynamically without page reload.
- Use loading spinner during API call.
- Handle errors gracefully.

Folder structure suggestion:
frontend/
├─ src/
│  ├─ components/
│  │  ├─ Header.js
│  │  ├─ Footer.js
│  │  ├─ AssessmentForm.js
│  │  ├─ ResultCard.js
│  │  └─ ResultChart.js
│  └─ App.js
backend/
├─ app.py
├─ utils.py
├─ requirements.txt

Output: Fully working React frontend + Flask backend, integrated. Clean, efficient code with clear comments. Include responsive UI, loading spinner, error handling, and elegant charts for results. Code should run locally efficiently and ready for deployment.
